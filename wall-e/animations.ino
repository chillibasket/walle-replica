 * 
 * Preset animations for all the servo motors can be defined here.
 * The animations consist of a set of position instructions for each
 * servo motor, along with a specified time for how long that position
 * should be held until the next animation instruction is executed.
 *
 * To add your own animation, follow these steps:
 * 1. Add a new 'case' statement with the number you want to associate with your animation.
 * 2. Follow the same format as below to add new movement instructions
 *    queue.push({time, head rotation, neck top, neck bottom, eye right, eye left, arm left, arm right})
 *    > The time needs to be a number in milliseconds
 *    > Each servo position value needs to be an integer (whole) number between 0-100
 *    > 0 = LOW servo position, 100 = HIGH servo position as specified in the wall-e_calibration sketch
 *    > If you want the servo to be disabled/not updated by a specific instruction, use -1
 * 3. Make sure that your 'case' statement ends with the "break;" command
